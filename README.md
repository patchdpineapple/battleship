# Project: Battleship

This is the final project of the test driven development part of the Javascript course from The Odin Project.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### How to play

Press Start in the title screen to start placing your ships.
Drag and Drop the ships onto the board to place them.
Click a ship from the ship selection to change its axis before placing on the board.
Click Reset button to remove all ships on the board.
Click Done when you are satisfied with your ship placement and to start the game.
In the game, click the CPU board to attack.
Click the Battleship icon at the top to restart the game.
Once the game is over, click Play Again to restart the game.

#### Rules

Each player has 5 ships of different lengths(2,3,4,5).
A player can attack once per turn. If the attack is a hit, the player can attack again.
Whoever sinks all the opponent's ships first wins the game.

### How to run the app

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
